# Automatic Database Update

This repository is a microservice of my Magic: The Gathering card search website. This is a nodejs lambda function that fetches bulk data from the [scryfall api](https://scryfall.com/docs/api) and saves the necessary data to a database, specifically [mongodb atlas](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/).
This lambda function is stored in [AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/), and is triggered daily, as to maintain a current database. 

# Setup

# Todo

Write Setup.
